- Use argparse or similar library than doing it yourself
- Add spaces between code methods/other functions
- Add in string formatters for easier use/readability for datetime and logging
- Avoid extra commenting when unnecessary (prior to each function for apps for fastapi)
- If requirements aren't met, its okay to crash rather than pull from the internet
